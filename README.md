# Immutable_Queue

In this I implement the Queue data structure which has generic type means we can initialize any type queue(object,Int,String etc)

To make the implementation immutable I use the referred object of List in place of List or in simple word everytime the operation(enqueue & dequeue) perform on the queue it will generate the new object which contain the updated queue
